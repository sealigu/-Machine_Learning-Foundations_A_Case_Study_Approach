# Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach
### From Coursera

## Introduction to this course
In this course, you will get hands-on experience with machine learning from a series of practical case-studies. Through hands-on practice with these cases, you will be able to apply machine learning methods in a wide range of domains. This course can be found at Coursera.

## Learning Goals
- Represent the data set as features to serve as input in a machine learning model.
- Implement the techniques in Jupyter Notebook.
- Apply regression, classification, clustering, retrieval, recommender systems and deep learning.
- The core differences in analysis by regression, classification and clustering.
- Identify potential application of machine learning in practice.
- Improving analyzing skills.
